    <h3>The Ominous Four</h3>
    <p>Keepers of the Haunted Mansion<br>The dark and eerie ambiance, with tension hanging thick in the air, casts a foreboding spell over the scene. The four skeletal figures, standing like sentinels beside the ominous house, seem frozen in time, their bony fingers clutching at the very essence of the night. The wind whispers through the twisted trees, and a sense of impending doom looms over the desolate landscape. It's a moment frozen in suspense, where the line between the living and the spectral blurs, and the secrets of the house remain shrouded in the enigma of the night.</p>
